# Cylog

Run Datalog queries on Cypher-supporting graph databases such as Neo4J.

This is an initial version (very work in progress) that can perform stratified Datalog queries, some arithmetic extensions, and has error reporting
only the developer would understand.

Maybe there will be more to it in the future.
